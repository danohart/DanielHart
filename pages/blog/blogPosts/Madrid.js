<p class="has-medium-font-size">Madrid takes you to the heart of the country of Spain, along with its rich history, beautiful architecture, and particularly well-taken care of community spaces and parks.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the first things I noticed when spending a little time here was it’s small, narrow streets. Perfect for starting your day by picking a street and walking down to find some coffee.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Coffee</strong> with milk is a common treat along with toast with an interesting topping, a seasoned tomato paste spread all over delicious bread. Both items are seemingly around every corner. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bars are aplenty. And Spanish red wine is absolutely my favorite. And it is CHEAP! Most bars have limited options for drinking, 1-2 types of beers, and a few bottles of wine, but they’re all excellent choices.</p>
