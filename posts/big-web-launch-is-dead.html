      There was time on the internet where companies would put up an “Under
      Construction” sign on their website, to raise anticipation of their new,
      and improved, web design or development efforts. But we&apos;re finding
      out that people just end up never checking back for a new version of your
      website…killing the reason to have a big web launch.

      If you have a website currently that you are embarking on revamping,
      improving, or pivoting the idea completely, with the ability to make pages
      private, or not promoting sections of your site until the time is right,
      putting your site under construction does more harm than good, as you want
      to always offer your visitor something. Improve your user experience as
      the years go on, over time.

      A webpage isn&apos;t going to be found by a visitor to your website unless
      you tell them about it. So if it&apos;s not linked somewhere, and
      you&apos;re not promoting it via your marketing channels and efforts, then
      you can keep improving on that section of your site until it&apos;s ready.

      The iteration of a website can look different for an eCommerce store
      versus a informative, educational blog. This website you&apos;re reading
      on has gone through major design changes through the years, and I recently
      just debuted this new design last week, but that&apos;s iteration. As
      design trends and the web gets more accessible to more people, it&apos;s
      good to revisit, and iterate over what works and what doesn&apos;t work
      for your visitors.

      Starting fresh? Get something valuable out there

    <p>
      While you&apos;re working on your major release to the public, because we
      understand a website takes time, think about something you can get out
      there right now that provides value to your visitor. Registering your
      domain name and getting at least a one page website up has great SEO
      benefits, as search engines such as Google and Bing trust websites that
      have been around for awhile. The longer, the better. So the sooner you
      have something that represents what you&apos;re doing, even if it&apos;s
      just explaining what is coming and how they can learn more, will help you
      in the long run when you finally reveal your finished product.
