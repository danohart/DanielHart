      Madrid takes you to the heart of the country of Spain, along with its rich
      history, beautiful architecture, and particularly well-taken care of
      community spaces and parks.

      One of the first things I noticed when spending a little time here was
      it&apos;s small, narrow streets. Perfect for starting your day by picking
      a street and walking down to find some coffee.

          <strong>Coffee</strong> with milk is a common treat along with toast
          with an interesting topping, a seasoned tomato paste spread all over
          delicious bread. Both items are seemingly around every corner.

          Bars are aplenty. And Spanish red wine is absolutely my favorite. And
          it is CHEAP! Most bars have limited options for drinking, 1-2 types of
          beers, and a few bottles of wine, but they&apos;re all excellent
          choices.
